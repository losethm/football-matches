# football-matches

In this project I used beautiful soup to scrape match data from teams in the English Premier League.

#### scraping
Used requests and beautiful soup python libraries to scrape data from https://fbref.com/. Then used pandas to export all of the data into a csv file called "matches.csv". I plan to use the data to try and see if I can predict match results.
